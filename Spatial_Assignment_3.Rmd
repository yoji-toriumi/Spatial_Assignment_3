##Map-3: Open spaces that are within a 400 meters of a body of water 
This map looks at which open spaces in Boston are within 400 meters of a body of water. The 400 meter buffer was chosen because it is often used as the normative planning standard for a 5 minute walk. This calculation was done by trimming the open spaces dataset to remove parks that extended beyond the limits of the water dataset, adding a 400m buffer to the water polygons, then calculating the intersection of the open space polygons and buffered water polygons. For this assignment, this map serves to satisfy calculation 14 (the number and proportion of C polygons that overlap with D polygons).

```{r matt plot 1, echo=FALSE}
#trimming open space dataset to remove Brewster Islands that fall outside the water polygon's xlim
bstn_openspace <- openspace[boundary, ]

#creating a 400m buffer from the water
hydro_buffer <- st_buffer(hydro, dist = 400) %>%
  st_union()

#calculating overlap in open space and water + buffer
openspace_water <- bstn_openspace %>%
  mutate(num_water = lengths(st_intersects(bstn_openspace, hydro_buffer))) %>%
  mutate(has_water = num_water > 0)

n_openspace_water <- sum(openspace_water$has_water)
n_openspace <- nrow(bstn_openspace)
pct_openspace_water <- n_openspace_water / n_openspace * 100

##Map-4: Hospitals with a 1000 meter radius of Boston University buildings
This map looks at which hospitals in Boston are within 1000 meters of a Boston University building. This calculation was done by filtering the universities only to include Boston University, adding a 1000m buffer to the BU building points, then subsetting the hospital dataset only to include those within the buffer. For this assignment, this map serves to satisfy calculation 2 (The number and proportion of B points with a specified distance of A points).

```{r matt plot 2, echo=FALSE}
#filtering for BU buildings
BU_universities <- universities %>%
  filter(grepl("Boston University", Name))

#adding a buffer to BU buildings
BU_buffer <- st_buffer(BU_universities, dist = 1000) %>%
  st_union

#subsetting hospitas within the buffer
BU_hospitals <- hospitals[BU_buffer, ]

#calculating number and percent of hospitals near BU
n_BU_hospitals <- nrow(BU_hospitals)
pct_BU_hospitals <- n_BU_hospitals / n_hospitals * 100

##Map-5: Neighborhoods by Community Center Count
This map shows the number of community centers in Boston neighborhoods. Dorchester has the most, while Brighton, the Harbor Islands, and other neighborhoods have the fewest. The sheer size of Dorchester largely explains this; a community center per square km map (not shown here) suggested that downtown had the highest density of community centers. 

```{r}
neighbor <- neighbor %>%
  mutate(num_commcenter = lengths(st_covers(neighbor, commcenter)))
ggplot(neighbor) +
  geom_sf(color = NA, 
          aes(fill = num_commcenter)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Boston neighborhoods\nby number of community centers",
                       breaks = breaks <- seq(0, 10, by = 1),
                       labels = paste(prettyNum(breaks, big.mark = ","),
                                      "commcenter")) +

  theme(legend.background = element_rect(fill = alpha("white", 0.5), 
                                         color = "gray"))
```


##Map-6: Open Spaces that Overlap with Water
This map shows the open spaces in Boston that overlap bodies of water. This analysis could be useful in understanding the unique ecologies and recreation opportunities of the city's parks. The data are not perfect - the map may miss parks that are directly adjacent to water but do not strictly overlap due to the way the polygons are drawn, and it excludes parks that wholly contain bodies of water (such as Franklin Park and Scarboro Pond within it.)

```{r}
openspace <- openspace %>%
  mutate(num_hydro = lengths(st_overlaps(openspace, hydro))) %>%
  mutate(has_hydro = num_hydro > 0)
n_hydro_openspace <- sum(openspace$has_hydro)

left_side  <- st_bbox(hydro)$xmin
top_side <- st_bbox(hydro)$ymax
ggplot(hydro) +
  geom_sf(fill = "lightblue", color = NA) +
  geom_sf(data = openspace,
          color = NA,
          aes(fill = has_hydro)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkseagreen1", "forestgreen"),
          name = "Boston Open Spaces\nby presence of a body of water", 
          labels = c("Open Space without\nan overlapping body of water",
                     "Open Space with an\noverlapping body of water")) +
  annotation_scale(location = "br") +
  annotation_north_arrow(location = "tr",
                         style = north_arrow_minimal()) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = left_side, 
           y = top_side - 2200, 
           label = paste(n_hydro_openspace ,
                         "of Boston's", 
                         length(openspace$Name),
                         "Open Spaces contain\nor overlap with", 
                         "a body of water."),
           hjust = 0, vjust = 0, size = 3) +
  theme_map() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gray"),
        legend.background = element_rect(fill = alpha("white", 0.5),
